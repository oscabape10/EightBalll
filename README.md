# eightBalll
![](./images/eightball.jpg)
A JavaScrpit game program. Control flow! It’s so powerful, in fact, that it can be used to tell someone’s fortune.
In this project I build the Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.
The user will be able to input a question, then the program will output a random fortune.
Enjoy!!!
